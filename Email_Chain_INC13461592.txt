	Hi Chittybabu,

	Thank you for your response.

	Vignesh will provide the exact server numbers shortly. You are correct that we have plans to upgrade these servers in early 2025. However, our immediate concern is ensuring adequate support during the upcoming peak season.

	Could you please advise on the process and associated costs for obtaining extended support for the RHEL 6.10 version to cover us through this critical period?

	Regards,

		RHEL 6 reached its end of life in 2020, and we have paid for extended support until June 30, 2024. Any extended support add on for a specific application needs to be taken as a separate case with additional cost.

				I have received the responses today and here they are for your review –

				 

				1. What would be the cost for adding additional 8 GB or 16 GB RAM size to the Layer7 & Apigee Outbound reverse proxy servers? Does CPU size also need to be increased if RAM size is getting upgraded? --> You would need to check with Wasantha Jayawardene for this.
				
				2. Does any cost involve upgrading the Operating System version to the RHEL 8 or 9 series from the existing RHEL 6.10 version? --> As discussed with Vignesh on call, there is no path to upgrade. You will have to deploy new VMs with latest OS and then install application on it.

				3. Which team or manager can assist in getting the extended support for the existing Operating System RHEL 6.10 version? --> Chitty babu would be able to help.

				 

				4. Will this Operating System version upgrade or RAM Size uplift can be performed before the change freeze starts if possible? --> Not possible as we do not have enough lead time

				 

				Please go through them and let me know if you have any other queries or concerns.

Hi Chittybabu,

Thank you for your response.

Vignesh will provide the exact server numbers shortly. You are correct that we have plans to upgrade these servers in early 2025. However, our immediate concern is ensuring adequate support during the upcoming peak season.

Could you please advise on the process and associated costs for obtaining extended support for the RHEL 6.10 version to cover us through this critical period?

Regards,
Michael

	RHEL 6 reached its end of life in 2020, and we have paid for extended support until June 30, 2024. Any extended support add on for a specific application needs to be taken as a separate case with additional cost.

	Could you provide the number of servers that require OS support and the duration for which you need the support?

			I have received the responses today and here they are for your review –

			 

			1. What would be the cost for adding additional 8 GB or 16 GB RAM size to the Layer7 & Apigee Outbound reverse proxy servers? Does CPU size also need to be increased if RAM size is getting upgraded? --> You would need to check with Wasantha Jayawardene for this.
			
			2. Does any cost involve upgrading the Operating System version to the RHEL 8 or 9 series from the existing RHEL 6.10 version? --> As discussed with Vignesh on call, there is no path to upgrade. You will have to deploy new VMs with latest OS and then install application on it.

			3. Which team or manager can assist in getting the extended support for the existing Operating System RHEL 6.10 version? --> Chitty babu would be able to help.

			 

			4. Will this Operating System version upgrade or RAM Size uplift can be performed before the change freeze starts if possible? --> Not possible as we do not have enough lead time

			 

			Please go through them and let me know if you have any other queries or concerns.

					Hi Sree,

					 

					If the server is hung, then you can proceed to restart the server to bring out of hung state.

					 

					Ensure the incident is update on who and when this was restarted and capture verification of the server in the incident.

					 

					If the server is not hung, and you are changing the state of the server, then you will require a change.

RHEL 6 reached its end of life in 2020, and we have paid for extended support until June 30, 2024. Any extended support add on for a specific application needs to be taken as a separate case with additional cost.

Could you provide the number of servers that require OS support and the duration for which you need the support?

Also, do you have plans to upgrade the servers to the latest RHEL version?

		I have received the responses today and here they are for your review –

		 

		1. What would be the cost for adding additional 8 GB or 16 GB RAM size to the Layer7 & Apigee Outbound reverse proxy servers? Does CPU size also need to be increased if RAM size is getting upgraded? --> You would need to check with Wasantha Jayawardene for this.
		
		2. Does any cost involve upgrading the Operating System version to the RHEL 8 or 9 series from the existing RHEL 6.10 version? --> As discussed with Vignesh on call, there is no path to upgrade. You will have to deploy new VMs with latest OS and then install application on it.

		3. Which team or manager can assist in getting the extended support for the existing Operating System RHEL 6.10 version? --> Chitty babu would be able to help.

		 

		4. Will this Operating System version upgrade or RAM Size uplift can be performed before the change freeze starts if possible? --> Not possible as we do not have enough lead time

		 

		Please go through them and let me know if you have any other queries or concerns.

					Hi Sree,

					 

					If the server is hung, then you can proceed to restart the server to bring out of hung state.

					 

					Ensure the incident is update on who and when this was restarted and capture verification of the server in the incident.

					 

					If the server is not hung, and you are changing the state of the server, then you will require a change.

	Hi Michael / Vignesh,

	 

	I have received the responses today and here they are for your review –

	 

	1. What would be the cost for adding additional 8 GB or 16 GB RAM size to the Layer7 & Apigee Outbound reverse proxy servers? Does CPU size also need to be increased if RAM size is getting upgraded? --> You would need to check with Wasantha Jayawardene for this.
	
	2. Does any cost involve upgrading the Operating System version to the RHEL 8 or 9 series from the existing RHEL 6.10 version? --> As discussed with Vignesh on call, there is no path to upgrade. You will have to deploy new VMs with latest OS and then install application on it.

	3. Which team or manager can assist in getting the extended support for the existing Operating System RHEL 6.10 version? --> Chitty babu would be able to help.

	 

	4. Will this Operating System version upgrade or RAM Size uplift can be performed before the change freeze starts if possible? --> Not possible as we do not have enough lead time

	 

	Please go through them and let me know if you have any other queries or concerns.

	This situation is becoming increasingly serious. Going into peak season without proper support for these critical systems is unimaginable.

					Hi Sree,

					 

					If the server is hung, then you can proceed to restart the server to bring out of hung state.

					 

					Ensure the incident is update on who and when this was restarted and capture verification of the server in the incident.

					 

					If the server is not hung, and you are changing the state of the server, then you will require a change.

Subject: RE: INC13461592 | Layer7 Reverse proxy Prod servers are rebooted and not accessible
From: /O=EXCHANGELABS/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=85368F6765E746A7A0458DCE4AD37DA4-SAGAR_GAME
Received: 2024-11-28 08:24:43.784000+00:00
Body:
Hi Michael / Vignesh,

 

I have received the responses today and here they are for your review –

 

1. What would be the cost for adding additional 8 GB or 16 GB RAM size to the Layer7 & Apigee Outbound reverse proxy servers? Does CPU size also need to be increased if RAM size is getting upgraded? --> You would need to check with Wasantha Jayawardene for this.

2. Does any cost involve upgrading the Operating System version to the RHEL 8 or 9 series from the existing RHEL 6.10 version? --> As discussed with Vignesh on call, there is no path to upgrade. You will have to deploy new VMs with latest OS and then install application on it.

3. Which team or manager can assist in getting the extended support for the existing Operating System RHEL 6.10 version? --> Chitty babu would be able to help.

 

4. Will this Operating System version upgrade or RAM Size uplift can be performed before the change freeze starts if possible? --> Not possible as we do not have enough lead time

 

Please go through them and let me know if you have any other queries or concerns.

Hi Sagar,

 

This situation is becoming increasingly serious. Going into peak season without proper support for these critical systems is unimaginable.

 

Can you please clarify who from Woolworths has made the decision regarding acquiring extended support for the RHEL 6.10 version?

Hi Sagar,

 

Is this in Dell Co? For query 1, the Dell charge won’t change but internal to Woolworths this may impact their chargeback rate – suggest they check with Wasantha Jayawardane on this. It is up to them if CPU needs to be upsized as well.

----Removing Customer----

 

Hi @Stephen <mailto:Stephen.Wiltshire@dell.com>  / @Victor <mailto:Victor.DelPradoJr@Dell.com>  / @Bradley <mailto:Brad_Bates@Dell.com> ,

 

We have below queries form the Application team and would need your inputs to answer them. 

I have mentioned my response to the best of my knowledge for OS related queries but please review them and correct if needed.

 

1. What would be the cost for adding additional 8 GB or 16 GB RAM size to the Layer7 & Apigee Outbound reverse proxy servers? Does CPU size also need to be increased if RAM size is getting upgraded? --> Awaiting information from Steve.

2. Does any cost involve upgrading the Operating System version to the RHEL 8 or 9 series from the existing RHEL 6.10 version? --> Already informed customer on call that there is no path to upgrade. They will have to deploy new VMs.

3. Which team or manager can assist in getting the extended support for the existing Operating System RHEL 6.10 version? --> Chitty babu would be able to help.

 

4. Will this Operating System version upgrade or RAM Size uplift can be performed before the change freeze starts if possible? --> Not possible as we do not have enough lead time.

 

I presume we can discuss this on the HCI/OS/Cloud call today but in case it gets cancelled due to workshop, please take a look at it.

 

Do let me know if you need any other information.

Hi @Stephen <mailto:Stephen.Wiltshire@dell.com>  / @Victor <mailto:Victor.DelPradoJr@Dell.com>  / @Bradley <mailto:Brad_Bates@Dell.com> ,

 

We have below queries form the Application team and would need your inputs to answer them. 

I have mentioned my response to the best of my knowledge for OS related queries but please review them and correct if needed.

 

1. What would be the cost for adding additional 8 GB or 16 GB RAM size to the Layer7 & Apigee Outbound reverse proxy servers? Does CPU size also need to be increased if RAM size is getting upgraded? --> Awaiting information from Steve.

2. Does any cost involve upgrading the Operating System version to the RHEL 8 or 9 series from the existing RHEL 6.10 version? --> Already informed customer on call that there is no path to upgrade. They will have to deploy new VMs.

3. Which team or manager can assist in getting the extended support for the existing Operating System RHEL 6.10 version? --> Chitty babu would be able to help.

 

4. Will this Operating System version upgrade or RAM Size uplift can be performed before the change freeze starts if possible? --> Not possible as we do not have enough lead time.

 

I presume we can discuss this on the HCI/OS/Cloud call today but in case it gets cancelled due to workshop, please take a look at it.

 

Do let me know if you need any other information.

Hi @Stephen <mailto:Stephen.Wiltshire@dell.com>  / @Victor <mailto:Victor.DelPradoJr@Dell.com>  / @Bradley <mailto:Brad_Bates@Dell.com> ,

 

We have below queries form the Application team and would need your inputs to answer them. 

I have mentioned my response to the best of my knowledge for OS related queries but please review them and correct if needed.

 

1. What would be the cost for adding additional 8 GB or 16 GB RAM size to the Layer7 & Apigee Outbound reverse proxy servers? Does CPU size also need to be increased if RAM size is getting upgraded? --> Awaiting information from Steve.

2. Does any cost involve upgrading the Operating System version to the RHEL 8 or 9 series from the existing RHEL 6.10 version? --> Already informed customer on call that there is no path to upgrade. They will have to deploy new VMs.

3. Which team or manager can assist in getting the extended support for the existing Operating System RHEL 6.10 version? --> Chitty babu would be able to help.

 

4. Will this Operating System version upgrade or RAM Size uplift can be performed before the change freeze starts if possible? --> Not possible as we do not have enough lead time.

 

I presume we can discuss this on the HCI/OS/Cloud call today but in case it gets cancelled due to workshop, please take a look at it.

 

Do let me know if you need any other information.

					Hi Sree,

					 

					If the server is hung, then you can proceed to restart the server to bring out of hung state.

					 

					Ensure the incident is update on who and when this was restarted and capture verification of the server in the incident.

					 

					If the server is not hung, and you are changing the state of the server, then you will require a change.
