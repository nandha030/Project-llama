Please note that above rules are only for connectivity between the old and new Maximo application and DO NOT impact distribution centers in any way.
Also
The MAS project has received special consideration and the necessary approvals for the requested changes have been sought from Angelo Clayton and H Salahifar . These changes, including the one discussed here, are essential for preparing the PROD environment for further development. The environment must be ready after the Christmas freeze; any delays will severely impact the project timelines for migrating from the EOL Maximo solution to the new MAS solution. Such delays could incur significant costs and risks for the business.
